Just walked out. Theater buzz still in my ears. Can’t shake the feeling of being in a weird wedding fever dream, you know? You're Cordially Invited has my brain marinated like a fish too long in the sun. Moments hit like popcorn, sudden, explosive — but some just, ya know, fall flat and end up like those cold, chewy bits at the bottom of the bucket. 

The bride's dress... a lace monster or sheer genius? Not sure, but like a jellyfish caught in a net of family drama. Oh, jeez, almost left my keys at the snack counter. The music, though, like listening to seagulls fighting over a stale hot dog. 

> Half the time I was just thinking, Is this real? The way they mixed surreal with Sunday lunch banter, it’s like... are my feet on the floor or am I floating in some pastel-tinged, overcatered void? I’ve gotta download the movie later. Think my cousin asked about it. 

The groom's face when the cake blew up — could’ve sworn I saw that happen once on a fishing trip, the way his mouth dropped open reminded me of when the bait gets taken by a goofily brave fish. Also, a pigeon got in somehow? Spent 10 minutes of the climactic scene trying to avoid its flapping, like trying to dodge the spotty Wi-Fi when you watch the movie online. 

> Pain in my lower back; the theater seats are a scam! Like they want to make you remember more with your body than with your mind. Not sure if that makes sense. The director definitely forgot the audience had bodies at some points.

The tension felt like reeling in a big one; the line could snap any moment. But then, suddenly a saxophone, like tripping over sea kelp while you’re just trying to enjoy the view. Who knew a mother-in-law could be both comic relief and possibly a metaphor for climate change? 

Here's a thought or just a ramble, both: the flower girl's rogue pet hamster subplot — blink, and you’d miss it — had me thinking about how life’s distractions are both annoying and oddly charming.
